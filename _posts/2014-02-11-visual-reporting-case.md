Praqma helps Visual Reporting implement test driven development and raises quality levels significantly with Continuous Delivery with Jenkins CI.<!--break-->

> "We got a comprehensive introduction to how Jenkins Continuous Integration works and what challenges and solutions to this approach of developing software may. This has resulted in a well-functioning Continuous Delivery setup, where a combination of test driven development and transparency in the programming have raised the quality levels significantly. Praqma was there all the way from the beginning, taking on the role as strategic advisor on all matters of the development as well as hands on configuration of tools."

- Founder & CEO of Visual Reporting, Laurits Søgaard Nielsen
