Grundfos and Praqma have been close partners since 2007 and have a constant eye on the optimization potential of the software development at Grundfos. Praqma has implemented the configuration management tool IBM Rational ClearCase in Grundfos’ software development departments around the world as well as implemented automated processes related to software testing.<!--break--> Praqmas' knowledge about automation, configuration management, and especially best practices from other customers is pivotal for Grundfos' software business.

Approximately 100 software engineers in Grundfos are responsible for new software for each pump variant in Grundfos' huge product portfolio. The software is used to program and control the pumps and Grundfos releases new software once or twice every month somewhere in the organization. In order to optimize resources Grundfos wanted to find a method that could automate the processes.

##Praqma’s knowledge of Jenkins CI is unmatched
> "We wanted to save time and resources, and at the same time increase productivity in our software testing. Praqma recommended the Open Source tool Jenkins CI, which is the Continuous Integration server that continuously integrates all software bits from the software engineers. Next, we introduced automated tool-test, so that we end out with a version of the software, which in principle, is ready for production. Where it previously took three or four months to conduct a manual test, it now only takes one week. We have optimized our resources by 300 percent and increased our productivity two or three times. These are measurable results that we are very proud of."

Says Flemming Ask Sørensen, Project Manager, Grundfos.

##Close sparring since 2007
Grundfos is inherently unable to upload the new software for its products over the internet and thus cannot deliver software directly to production. However, the process has been optimized, and Grundfos continues to have a sharp eye on improvements in the development department.

> "We started working with configuration management in 2007, because we needed a tool that could manage the software development in real time in India, China, and Denmark - across time zones as well as borders. We were recommended to contact Lars Kruse from Praqma, who has educated us and been a great partner in our work on implementing IBM Rational ClearCase. Three years later, we examined best practices in relation to automating the processes associated with software testing and here Lars Kruse and the rest of Praqma once again proved their worth. Their knowledge on Jenkins CI has been a very important element for the results we have achieved."

Says Flemming Ask Sørensen.

##Praqma understands our wishes
Praqma has since 2007 been a permanent Grundfos supplier and, according to Flemming Ask Sørensen;

> "Praqmas' strength is that they understand what we want. They have an enormous expertise in handling Jenkins CI, and they are very quick to write plugins that work and drive the entire testing process in the configuration system we have chosen. We are in daily contact with Praqma and they are outstandingly good at taking care of things quickly. We greatly appreciate that."

Says Flemming Ask Sørensen. And continues;

> "A further advantage with Praqma is that they have other similar customers with challenges that we might run into one day. Praqma is a center of excellence, and we all contribute input to the Continuous Delivery method. Therefore, there is a great deal of experience exchange hat comes with the package we buy from Praqma."
