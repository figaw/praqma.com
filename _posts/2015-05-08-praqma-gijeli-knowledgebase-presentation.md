## Agenda

**Goals of presentation**:

* learn how edit and add content
* learn how to serve it as a webpage
<!--break-->


Work flow of presentation:

* Pinside and Praqma/Gijeli Docker container are two independent and different things
    * Pinside is a plain Git repository with markdown files with our knowledge (and some other content to make nice webpages)
    * Praqma/Gijeli is a container we have made that can serve Jekyll websites, offer Git, Ruby and Liquid tool support

* **Edit or add content**
    * open the Pinside Praqma GitHub private repository
    * browse it, try to edit or add a file
    * clone it
    * edit files with favorite editor
    * push content

* **serve a Jekyll website**:
    * using your locally installed tools, Jekyll Ruby and Liquid
    * using Praqma/Gijeli container (assuming you are already able to run Docker containers - it is not part of this presentation)


That's it folks!
