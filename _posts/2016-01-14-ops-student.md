## We're hiring - are you an up and coming IT Operations expert?
{: .subtitle}

At Praqma we specialize in Continuous Delivery as well as DevOps. 
Right now we're experiencing massive growth and we are looking for more experts to join our ranks.
With the growth of our company comes the growth of our infrastructure, but like the proverbial shoemaker whose children walk barefoot, we prioritize our customer's needs over our own. 
We have a backlog of planned work but we could definitely use a hand getting where we want to be.
<!--break-->

Can you take responsibility for maintaining and developing our internal IT infrastructure?
{: .highlight}

We prefer to utilize cloud hosted services where it make sense, but we also have internal infrastructure to host our research labs (virtual machines currently on ESXi). 
Like everybody else we need reliable internet connection, networking, VPN services, printers and much more. 
We use almost every platform, tool and service you could imagine in a very diverse software organization.

We are looking for a self-managed IT enthusiast with a strong technical foundation. 
You are capable of learning what you need to know but don't already. 
You will be occupied with a diverse range of challenging tasks and get to actively contribute to driving their direction as well.

Our current estimate is 10 hours a week. You won't be tasked with stand-by service, as we are typically able to handle any critical problems ourselves.
To get started, you will spend some on-site time at our office in Allerød, north of Copenhagen, but working hours will be very flexible and you will be able to work online as well.

We are looking for:

 * You have a grasp on Unix system administration
 * You understand virtualization technology and are comfortable with IT diversity.
 * You have an unquenchable thirst for automating everything.
 * You are familiar with agile software working practices.
 * You are familiar with open source, maybe you are already contributing to a community.
 * You are proud. You are good at what you do and you know your stuff - and still, you are improving.

We can offer you:

 * A diverse range of projects and technologies to sink your teeth into
 * A flexible working environment
 * Colleagues that share your passion for creating world class development environments

Send us a mail at jobs@praqma.net and attach the following:

 * Your resume.
 * A cover letter explaining why you believe Praqma is all you.
