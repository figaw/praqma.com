For those of you who missed it, here is Mike Long's talk from NDC on Continuous Delivery for Embedded Software.

<!--break-->

Continuous Delivery is all the rage, but many of the practices are not applied in the embedded world because the literature seems to focus on the web development community. That is a great shame, because there is a great deal we can apply on our embedded software development projects.

This talk will show you how to apply some of the key techniques, such as embedded versioning and software traceability, embedded continuous delivery pipelines, acceptance testing with hardware, automatic deployment to hardware, continuous deployment. Beyond that, the talk will show some real-life examples of companies who are at the leading edge of this adoption.
