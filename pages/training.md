# Training _by Praqma_{: .highlight}

## Know your tools - learn the secrets
At Praqma we pride ourselves on being tool experts.
We don't just skim a howto and get to work.  
We strive to understand everything about the tools we use, evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, test them in production-like environments and learn the best way to use them.

## We like to share
We strive to change the world for the better, a little bit at a time.
One of our favorite activities is teaching great developers and operations experts how best to employ brilliant software.

We have a bias towards **hands-on training** because we think it is best way to learn (and also the most fun)! 
You can expect all of our classes to be taught by our experts in an interactive, bring-your-laptop approach.

As *certified training partners* for toolstacks such as **Docker** and **Atlassian** and as experts in **Jenkins CI** and **Git**, we can’t wait to help you build better, deploy faster and run smoother.
