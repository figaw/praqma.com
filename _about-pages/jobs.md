### CoDer at heart


We abbreviate Continuous delivery as CoDe. _Co_ for Continuous and _De_ for delivery.

The position title we use is "Continuous Deliverer" or just plain "CoDer".

If you know what we mean then you've probably got it - DevOps. You are already doing it, aren't you? That is why you are reading this page.

If you're a CoDer at heart we encourage you to contact us. We have offices in Allerød, Aarhus, Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm and we're hiring in all locations.
