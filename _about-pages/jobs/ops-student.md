## We're hiring - are you an up and coming IT Operations expert?
{: .subtitle}

In Praqma we are specialists in continuous delivery as well as devops.  Right now we're experiencing massive growth and we are looking for more experts to join our ranks.  

But but like the proverbial shoemaker whose children walk barefoot, we prioritize our customer needs over our own infrastructure maintenance.  We have a backlog of already planned work, but we could use a hand to get where we want to go.

Can you take responsibility for maintaining and developing our internal IT infrastructure?
{: .highlight}

We prefer to utilize cloud hosted services where it make sense, but we also have internal infrastructure to host our research labs (virtual machines currently on ESXi).  And like everybody else we need internet connection, networking, VPN services, printers, and much more.  We use almost every platform, tool and service you could imagine in a diverse software organization.

We are looking for a self-managed IT enthusiast with a strong technical foundation.  You will be capable of learning what you need to know but don't already.  We will keep you busy with challenging tasks and we expect you to actively contribute to driving the direction as well.

You will need to spend some on-site time at our office in Allerød north of Copenhagen to get started and when physical needs must, but normally working hours will be very flexible and you will be able to work online.
Our current estimate is 10 hours a week. We do not need any stand-by service, as we are typically able to handle any critical operation problems ourselves.

Skills we are looking for:

 * You have a grasp on Unix system administration
 * You understand virtualization technology and are comfortable with IT diversity.
 * You have an unquenchable urge to automate everything.
 * You are familiar with agile software working practices.
 * You are familiar with open source, maybe you are already contributing to a community.
 * You are proud. You are good at what you do and you know your stuff - and still, you are improving.

What we can offer you:

 * A diverse range of projects and technologies to sink your teeth into
 * A flexible working environment
 * Colleagues that share your passion for creating world class development environments

Send us your resumé and a cover letter explaining why you believe Praqma is all you.
