## Discover your path to improvement with a Continuous Delivery Assessment
{: .subtitle}

At Praqma, while helping many companies with their continuous delivery implementation and throughout the seminars, conferences and training classes we conduct, the most common questions we get concerning continuous delivery are “Where do we start?”, “What to do next?” and “What’s the benefit of this particular step?”.

We created the Continuous Delivery Assessment as a tool to help teams get answers to these questions.

A Continuous Delivery Assessment consists of four main parts:

* A full day workshop
* A series of qualitative interviews
* A report
* A Q&A session after you’ve had a chance to read the report

## The workshop

At the workshop we recommend that people who have interests or stakes in the implementation of the continuous delivery approach in your organization participate.
Ideally if your organization uses different technology stacks or processes, they should all be represented.
Software developers, build and release engineers, QA personnel, system architects, functional testers as well as project managers could contribute to such a workshop.
The ideal number of participants is in the range of 10-20 people.

## The qualitative interviews
The day after the workshop we will arrange a series of short 30-60 minute interviews with different people in your staff representing different roles in your current process.
In these interviews we will focus on understanding your current processes, tool utilization, skill levels and approaches.

If possible the interviews should be conducted in a setup where the actual tools that people use are available, so that we can get actual demonstrations of the workflows that are being used.

## The report
After the two days on-site with you, we will go home with the elicited empirical material and write up a report of findings and observations accompanied by suggestions of concrete recommendations or mitigations.

All our recommendations will be given to you in a format that allows each individual statement to serve as the foundation for an epic or user story, accompanied by a recommended priority as well.

The report will be able to serve as a backlog or roadmap for the journey you are about to start.

Typically focusing on means such as automation of verification, breakdown of monolithic structures, process optimizations in general and better utilization of a process supporting toolstack.

## The Q&A session
After you have received the report, and have had a chance to discuss it internally, we will be happy to come by for a final meeting at your location and spend an hour or two on discussing the content and answering any questions related to it or our rationale.

## A model-based assessment

We’ve learned to recognize various signs indicating different levels of ‘continuous delivery maturity’ and have used them to create a model.
We use the model to categorize our findings, observations and recommendations.

At Praqma we are all very engaged in continuous delivery and find the model incredibly useful when discussing with clients, colleagues, user groups, companions, audiences etc.
