## Assess your current situation and lay a path into the future
{: .subtitle}

Many companies prioritize the ability to be able to have a stable budget over having one that varies. They simply do not want to be dependent on a tool that isn't supported.

Working with Praqma means that you can sign a Service Level Agreement that is custom tailored to your exact needs. It enables you to actually calculate the Cost of Ownership of your Open Source tools and compare it with the price tag of a proprietary tool.

Besides a stable budget - an Open Source Service Level Agreement with Praqma gives you additional benefits
{: .highlight}

* We are a team of experienced developers - we know when a developer's workspace is efficient and when it's not. We would never compromise the pace of a developer's productivity.
* The combination of our different skills means, that we can literally service any tool or issue. You will you have access to our entire team.
* We have setup chains that are so tight, that every single code commit is automatically validated and tested right up to the point where it will pass as release candidate (or rejected in the attempt). Just try to imagine what a fine masked safety net of that kind can do to a project's velocity.
* We have setup tool stacks that are compliant with both FDA, ISO, and Solvency regulatory rules.
* Unless IP rules prevent us, we always deliver features, fixes, and solutions to the Public Domain community of the tool involved. This implies that you will have instant access to all the solutions that we have ever delivered to all the customers and communities we have ever serviced. You will become part of an exclusive club of Praqma customers who implicitly work together.
* You can use the account you have with us for Second Line Support, bug fixing, tool setup, configuration, training, coaching, strategic planning, or feature development. We will even write your unit tests for you - It's your account, you decide.

It all starts with a visit!

Call us and invite us to a cup of coffee - we drink a lot of coffee.
